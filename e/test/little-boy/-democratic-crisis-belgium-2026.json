  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How many court orders has Belgium ignored?",
      "answer": "Belgium has ignored over 9,000 court orders, primarily related to asylum seekers' right to shelter. Belgian judges themselves have described this as 'rogue state' behavior.",
      "category": "rule_of_law"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is particracy in Belgium?",
      "answer": "Particracy is a system where political parties, rather than elected representatives, hold effective power. In Belgium, party presidents negotiate coalitions, appoint ministers, and impose voting discipline, reducing parliament to a rubber-stamp chamber.",
      "category": "political_system"
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does Belgium spend on forced inactivity?",
      "answer": "Belgium spends €21-24 billion annually (approximately €1 million per hour) maintaining 978,000 people in forced inactivity, rather than investing in activation or contribution mechanisms.",
      "category": "social_policy"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Belgium's democracy at risk?",
      "answer": "Multiple indicators suggest democratic erosion: systematic non-compliance with court rulings, laws restricting civil society (Quintin Law), criminalization of protest (Anti-Casseur Law), and concentration of power in unelected party structures. Scholars characterize this as 'illiberal drift' rather than totalitarianism.",
      "category": "democracy"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Arizona budget in Belgium?",
      "answer": "The Arizona coalition budget (2025-2029) plans €9.2 billion in adjustments, with 60% coming from social cuts. Despite this austerity, the Federal Planning Bureau projects the deficit will reach €40 billion (6.5% GDP) by 2030.",
      "category": "budget"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why doesn't the EU act against Belgium on rule of law?",
      "answer": "Despite documented non-compliance with judicial rulings that would trigger Article 7 discussions if occurring in newer member states, no formal EU proceedings have been initiated against Belgium. Critics describe this as a double standard.",
      "category": "eu_context"
    },
    {
      "question": "What alternatives exist to the current system?",
      "answer": "The Ouaisfieu project proposes 'Provisioned Contributive Economy' (ECP) - using existing legal frameworks (2005 volunteering law, fiscal rulings) to transform €21-24B passive spending into active citizen contribution, for a project budget of €24,000.",
