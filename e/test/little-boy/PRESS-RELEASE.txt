BRUSSELS, BELGIUM — A comprehensive investigation released today by 
Ouaisfieu, a civic counter-institution focused on democratic oversight, 
reveals that Belgium, a founding member of the European Union, has 
systematically ignored over 9,000 court orders. Senior Belgian judges 
have described this pattern as characteristic of a "rogue state."

KEY FINDINGS:

• 9,000+ COURT ORDERS IGNORED: Belgian state has refused to comply with 
  judicial rulings on asylum seekers' right to shelter, choosing to pay 
  fines rather than obey the law.

• €21-24 BILLION ANNUAL WASTE: Belgium spends approximately €1 million 
  per hour maintaining 978,000 people in "forced inactivity" rather than 
  investing in activation mechanisms.

• 2.1 MILLION AT POVERTY RISK: 18.3% of Belgian citizens face poverty 
  risk, while 58% of students report food insecurity.

• €40 BILLION DEFICIT PROJECTED: Despite €9.2 billion in planned 
  austerity cuts (Arizona budget), the Federal Planning Bureau projects 
  the deficit will reach 6.5% of GDP by 2030.

• 20-25% TRUST IN PARTIES: Public confidence in political parties has 
  fallen to historic lows, fueling anti-system movements.

"When a state systematically ignores its own courts, it operates as a 
rogue state," stated a Belgian magistrate in documents reviewed by 
Ouaisfieu. "The rule of law exists only on paper."

The investigation raises urgent questions about EU rule of law 
enforcement. While the Commission has initiated proceedings against 
Hungary and Poland, no formal action has been taken against Belgium 
despite documented non-compliance with judicial rulings.
